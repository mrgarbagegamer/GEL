\section*{Topic: 0.4 Your First Real Exploration}
Recall the 5 steps, \textbf{explore}, \textbf{discuss}, \textbf{conjecture}, \textbf{apply}, \textbf{extend} and the 3 guiding principles, \textbf{exploration}, \textbf{explanation}, and \textbf{fun}!

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick pairs of two numbers, when is their sum even? When is their sum odd? Can their sum be zero? When is their sum positive, when is their sum negative? Any conjectures?
    \item Do the same for subtraction.
    \item Do the same for multiplication.
    \item Do the same for division.
    \item What can you say about the sum, difference, product, or quotient of two numbers?
    \item When adding two numbers, when is their sum divisible by 3? Divisible by 4? etc. Can you generalize?
    \item What about other operations? Can you generalize?
\end{enumerate}
