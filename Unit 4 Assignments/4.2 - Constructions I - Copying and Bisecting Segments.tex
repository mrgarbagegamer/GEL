\section*{Topic: 4.2 Constructions I - Copying and Bisecting Segments}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What does a ruler do?
    \item What is a radius? Draw a circle and mark its radius.
    \item What is a diameter? How does it relate to a radius?
    \item What is a circumference? Label the circumference of your circle.
    \item What tool can you use to draw a perfect circle? (Hint: Look right in front of you)
    \item Take the compass in front of you and draw another circle.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Mark the radius of the circle and measure its length.
              \item Place the tip of your compass on the center of the circle and set the end of the compass to the circumference.
              \item Keeping the width of your compass the same, move to a different point and draw a new circle.
              \item Draw and measure the radius of this circle. What do you notice?
          \end{itemize}
    \item Draw the line segment $\overline{AB}$ with a length of 5.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Set the center and the end of the compass to points $A$ and $B$.
              \item Move the center of the compass to a new point and draw an arc.
              \item Draw and measure the radius of this circle. What do you notice about its length? Why is this the case?
          \end{itemize}
    \item Using what you've learned, describe how to copy a line segment.
    \item Could you double or triple the size of a line segment with this method? Attempt it.
\end{enumerate}
