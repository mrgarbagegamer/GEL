\section*{Topic: 3.1 Classifying and Drawing Triangles}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item What is a triangle? How many sides does a triangle have?
    \item Based on the name, what do you think an equilateral triangle is? Can you draw one?
    \item What do you think an isosceles triangle is? Can you draw one?
    \item What do you think a scalene triangle is? Can you draw one?
    \item Can you find any similarities between these triangles? Any differences?
    \item Using your understanding, try to formally define equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles.
    \item What are right angles, acute angles, and obtuse angles? Can you draw one of each?
    \item Based on your understanding of these types of angles, can you guess what an obtuse, acute, and right triangle is? Draw one of each.
    \item A triangle on a coordinate plane is made up of points $A(0, 2)$, $B(5, 1)$, and $C(-3, -5)$.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Find the lengths of $\Bar{AB}$, $\Bar{BC}$, and $\Bar{AC}$.
              \item Based on the side lengths, is the triangle equilateral, isosceles, or scalene?
              \item Looking at the triangle, does it appear to be acute, right, or obtuse? Can you prove this? (hint: slope)
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
