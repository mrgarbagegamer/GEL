\section*{Topic: 3.6 Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item What could you say about two congruent apples?
    \item What are corresponding angles? Draw two parallel lines and a transverse line, and label the corresponding angles.
    \item Draw two triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle XYZ$ that satisfy $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle XYZ$.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item What angles in each triangle do you think correspond to one another? What sides correspond?
              \item If $\angle ABC = 90^{\circ}$ and $\angle ACB = 40^{\circ}$, find $\angle XYZ$ and $\angle XZY$. What do you notice?
              \item Find $\angle YXZ$ and $\angle BAC$. What do you notice about these angles? Are there any similarities?
              \item If $\overline{AB} = 3$ and $\overline{BC} = 4$, find $\overline{XY}$ and $\overline{YZ}$. What do you notice?
              \item Using the Pythagorean Theorem, find sides $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{XZ}$. Are there any similarities?
              \item What pattern do you notice between these two triangles? Are they the same for all congruent triangles?
          \end{itemize}
    \item Using what you have learned, write a conjecture about congruent triangles and their sides and angles.
\end{enumerate}
