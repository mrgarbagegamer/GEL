\section*{Topic: 3.2 Interior and Exterior Angles of Triangles}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item Draw a triangle and label its angles. What do the angles add up to?
    \item Can you draw a triangle whose interior angles add up to less or more than this number?
    \item How are interior angles related to the sides of a triangle? (Hint: Draw an equilateral triangle and look at the angles)
    \item Draw a triangle and label the angles $A$, $B$, and $C$.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Find the measures of angles $A$, $B$, and $C$.
              \item Extend the line opposite of angle $A$. Find the supplementary angle and name it $D$.
              \item Find the sum of the 2 triangle angles not supplementary to angle $D$. Compare this to angle $D$.
              \item What do you notice? Can you test something similar with another triangle?
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
